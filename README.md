![What This Library Would Look Like In Real Life](https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fowkjjychkc2mw4hokzw.jpeg)

A repository of links to useful audiobooks required for an in-depth classical education. Except unlike most book lists, this list will not contain fluffy feel-good books that contain no real value for the listener.  

Sadly, there is no particular order for this book list. I will only add to it when I come across a book that I believe is valuable enough to be added to the list.

I hope you find this collection useful.

[Candide - By Voltaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p80wPlowp1A)
Although the book's premise may be a bit basic for the average reader, in the day it was written, it was revolutionary. The book is a complete mockery of all that was held sacred in 1700s society. It was one of the first early books that made people aware of how ludicrous most rules really are. It might even be said that the book utlimately contributed to fueling the flames of the enlightenment era.

[My Confession - By Leo Tolstoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d3NrX1b6jU)
Although there is much to be said about the absolute brokenness of Tolstoy as a person, there is undoubtedly a quality about this work in particular which allows us to still somewhat admire his effort. Although Tolstoy had his faults, in this book he clearly outlines his struggle to believe in Christ throughout his life. He clearly, and quiete beautifully, lays out his struggle with depression, and gives readers a terrifying sense of what it's truly like to be suicidal.

[Lessons Of History - By Will Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enJRIdmVHRE&t=10029s)
Although brief, Durant's historical account of economics and philosophy will give every reader and listener a basic framework to understand how the world works. This book covers everything from how increased economic growth led to loose sexual behavior to how the warring ideologies of conservatism and liberalism are always fighting against each other - and how they ultimately lead to feedback loops throughout history.

[The Psychology of Human Misjudgement - By Charlie Munger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws)
Charlie Munger was the silent giant behind the success of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Both men were partners who helped each other build businesses and acquire net worths well over a billion dollars. What's interesting is that, although the article has been included in several books, this college lecture by Charlie Munger goes into deep psychological explanations regarding human motives and biases on a level that very few books are capable of doing. That's why I've chosen to add it to this list. By listening to it, you will gain a valuable insight into practical psychology that can be used to build vast amounts of wealth.

[Basic Economics - By Thomas Sowell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrPxEmOV0YI&t=24792s)
Want to understand the dangers of rent control policies? Then this is the book for you. In a broad stroke, Sowell manages to explain even some of the more complicated aspects of economics to the average person in clear, simple language. You'll learn about crony capitalism and the dangers of too much government intervention. But please be careful, although this book is a masterpiece of basic economic teachings, sometimes Sowell gets too caught up in his hate for state intervention. Take all that he says with a grain of salt and do your own economic research.

[The Prince - By Niccol√≤ Machiavelli](https://youtu.be/mr2HO8nV3Ws)
You can't write a book list of important books without including this one. I've personally read it at least 4 times. In it, Machiavelli describes how power structures really work, giving numerous examples of brute force and article diplomacy - and the different results they help to achieve. If you're interested in pursuing a political career or climbing the social ladder, then this is a must-read.

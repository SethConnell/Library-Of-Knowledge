![What This Library Would Look Like In Real Life](https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fowkjjychkc2mw4hokzw.jpeg)

A repository of links to useful audiobooks required for an in-depth classical education. Except unlike most book lists, this list will not contain fluffy feel-good books that contain no real value for the listener.  

Sadly, there is no particular order for this book list. I will only add to it when I come across a book that I believe is valuable enough to be added to the list.

I hope you find this collection useful.

[The Audiobiography Of Benjamin Franklin - By Benjamin Franklin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qExGjavdS7g)
The story of Benjamin Franklin's long and interesting life are useful if you're an overachiever like he was. Not only was Franklin a renowned statesman, speaker, writer, and inventor, but he was also a business man as well. In fact, it was only through his business success that he was able to devote his life to academic achievements once he retired at the age of 30. If that's something you're interested in, then you should absolutely listen to this

[Candide - By Voltaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p80wPlowp1A)
Although the book's premise may be a bit basic for the average reader, in the day it was written, it was revolutionary. The book is a complete mockery of all that was held sacred in 1700s society. It was one of the first early books that made people aware of how ludicrous most rules really are. It might even be said that the book utlimately contributed to fueling the flames of the enlightenment era.

[My Confession - By Leo Tolstoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d3NrX1b6jU)
Although there is much to be said about the absolute brokenness of Tolstoy as a person, there is undoubtedly a quality about this work in particular which allows us to still somewhat admire his effort. Although Tolstoy had his faults, in this book he clearly outlines his struggle to believe in Christ throughout his life. He clearly, and quiete beautifully, lays out his struggle with depression, and gives readers a terrifying sense of what it's truly like to be suicidal.

[Lessons Of History - By Will Durant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enJRIdmVHRE&t=10029s)
Although brief, Durant's historical account of economics and philosophy will give every reader and listener a basic framework to understand how the world works. This book covers everything from how increased economic growth led to loose sexual behavior to how the warring ideologies of conservatism and liberalism are always fighting against each other - and how they ultimately lead to feedback loops throughout history.

[The Psychology of Human Misjudgement - By Charlie Munger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws)
Charlie Munger was the silent giant behind the success of billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Both men were partners who helped each other build businesses and acquire net worths well over a billion dollars. What's interesting is that, although the article has been included in several books, this college lecture by Charlie Munger goes into deep psychological explanations regarding human motives and biases on a level that very few books are capable of doing. That's why I've chosen to add it to this list. By listening to it, you will gain a valuable insight into practical psychology that can be used to build vast amounts of wealth.

[Basic Economics - By Thomas Sowell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrPxEmOV0YI&t=24792s)
Want to understand the dangers of rent control policies? Then this is the book for you. In a broad stroke, Sowell manages to explain even some of the more complicated aspects of economics to the average person in clear, simple language. You'll learn about crony capitalism and the dangers of too much government intervention. But please be careful, although this book is a masterpiece of basic economic teachings, sometimes Sowell gets too caught up in his hate for state intervention. Take all that he says with a grain of salt and do your own economic research.

[The Prince - By Niccol√≤ Machiavelli](https://youtu.be/mr2HO8nV3Ws)
You can't write a book list of important books without including this one. I've personally read it at least 4 times. In it, Machiavelli describes how power structures really work, giving numerous examples of brute force and article diplomacy - and the different results they help to achieve. If you're interested in pursuing a political career or climbing the social ladder, then this is a must-read.

[Age Of Reason - By Thomas Paine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycgkogD7Jw4&t=17032s)
This is perhaps the best book I've read to understand the hostile environment that existed among America's early founders. It is further proof that America has always been divided politically. The book itself are the drawn-out thoughts of a man that was far ahead of his time. In Age Of Reason, Paine successfully explains his views on the subjects of improved schooling systems, the moral flaws in Christianity, the capacity of man for self-improvement, and the moral failings of certian politcal leaders. It is a controversial work that undoubtedly led Paine to be an outcast in his own country in spite of the fact that he is the one who ultimately inspired the American Revolution.

[The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes - By Sir Author Cannon Doyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp_6Jg5pLYc)
The adventures of Sherlock Holmes become far more interesting once you realize that it was based loosely off of a real-life person. Years after Doyle released the Sherlock Holmes adventures to the general public, he confirmed that it was based off his former teacher at medical school named Joseph Bell. Bell, who was supposedly a true logician and master of solving medical problems would later be used as the basis of the hit television show House M.D.. Although I was originally against adding fictional books to the list, I think it belongs here. It's hard to be educated unless you learn from the OG of reason himself, Sherlock Holmes.

[The Republic - By Plato](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqGsg01ycpk)
This book is the perfect example of what true in-depth conversations are supposed to sound like. Even though Plato may have taken liberties when he described the debates between himself and other philosophers like Socrates, it's pretty obvious that their convserations were by no means as shallow and useless as the ones people have today. In this book, Plato and his collegues sit together and come up with what they describe as a "practical" society in which people are meant to serve for the betterment of the group. Little did Plato know that his ideas would eventually be tried out in full force under the name of "fascism". Although it might be wrong politcally and morally speaking, the entire book is definitely food for thought.

[The Art Of War - By Sun Tzu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7rhovBK_eA)
Weak people always act bigger than they are. But true strength lies in being stronger than you seem. This is just one example of the kind of overal strategic thinking contained in this book. Sun Tzu was a Chinese general, military strategist, writer and philosopher who tried his best to break down the basic princples behind strategic success in war. Many people now use the book to help them in business, since the same rules apply in both worlds.

[The Book Of Five Rings - Miyamotto Musashi](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wJ57Jl01aT0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLDMP_BDm7BtNJ6WHxgYD-KVUut5zA)
Miyamotto Musashi had already won hundreds of sword battles by the time he was just 30 years old. He was a master swordsman and warrior who fought in Japan. Musashi later attributed his success in combat to a number of maxims and principles, which he outlined in his book.

[The Gospel of Wealth - Andrew Carnagie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBlj1_e0uXI)
Andrew Carnagie lived in the glory days of unchecked, unbridled capitalism - and abuse in business was rampant by rich elites who used their wealth to destroy competition and exploit workers. So the richest man in the world at the time, Andrew Carnagie, set out to help provide rules that he though extremely rich people should follow to help build up society instead of tear it down. In this book, Carnagie explains that it is the moral duty of rich people to make the world a better place. He also pointed out that rich people have a better chance of actually using their resources for good because they would know how to deploy them. The book is a response to socialism, which was just gaining ground at the time.

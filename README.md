# Library Of Knowledge
A repository of links to useful audiobooks required for an in-depth classical education. Except unlike most book lists, this list will not contain fluffy feel-good books that contain no real value for the listener.  

Sadly, there is no particular order for this book list. I will only add to it when I come across a book that I believe is valuable enough to be added to the list.

I hope you find this collection useful.

[Candide - By Voltaire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p80wPlowp1A)
#### Although the book's premise may be a bit basic for the average reader, in the day it was written, it was revolutionary. The book is a complete mockery of all that was held sacred in 1700s society. It was one of the first early books that made people aware of how ludicrous most rules really are. It might even be said that the book utlimately contributed to fueling the flames of the enlightenment era.

[My Confession - By Leo Tolstoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d3NrX1b6jU)
#### Although there is much to be said about the absolute brokenness of Tolstoy as a person, there is undoubtedly a quality about this work in particular which allows us to still somewhat admire his effort. Although Tolstoy had his faults, in this book he clearly outlines his struggle to believe in Christ throughout his life. He clearly, and quiete beautifully, lays out his struggle with depression, and gives readers a terrifying sense of what it's truly like to be suicidal.
